Do whatever you want. Ship an identical app, sell the code as is, print it out and eat it, spraypaint it on your grandma's fridge, put it into an LLM and ask it to impersonate me. This intellectual non-property is released into the public domain with appreciation for my many teachers and friends who have taught me things and the countless people on StackOverflow whose answers made their way into my projects throughout the years.
